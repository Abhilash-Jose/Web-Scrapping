Project 2:
Web Scapping using Request : https://github.com/Abhilash-Jose/Web-Scrapping/blob/main/Web%20Scrapping%20Using%20Request.ipynb

Website: https://www.timesjobs.com/

<b> Objective:</b>
In this project, I performed web scraping using the Requests library along with Beautiful Soup. The goal was to extract job titles, required skills, and application links for the latest job postings on the TimesJobs website, while also filtering out any unwanted skills.
